My project was a Dj beatpad/drumkit. It functions very simply. You can either click the buttons or press the associated keys in order to produce that button's unique sound. If you press the left shift key the program will record the keys you press in order to allow you to play them back in a loop. Once you press the left shift key again it will automatically start playing the loop. At this time you will have the ability to stop the loop from playing. Should you pres stop the option to start the loop back up or to clear the loop will become available.
